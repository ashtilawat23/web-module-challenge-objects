Add to the function createMenuItems below so it will create objects following the same format found above for latte and breakfastBurrito (name, price, category).

Test your createMenuItems function by doing the following:
  1. Pass values to createMenuItems in order to create the objects (menu items)
  2. Create at least 3 menu items (objects) of your choosing making sure they have name, price, and category keys
  3. Log each returned object to the console  
  
  For example: createMenuItem("pizza",5,"lunch") would return this as the object: {name:"Pizza",price:5,category:"lunch"}

You're having a lunch special! 25% off for teachers and students, 10% off for everyone else. Add a method to the 
burger object below that automatically calculates price depending on the a string received as a parameter. 

Using the burger object below do the following:
  1. Add a method called discount to the burger object 
  2. The discount method should accept a string that could be "teacher", "student", or "public"
  3. Depending on the string, it will return the correct discounted price
  4. Log the correct returned price to the console

  For example: burger.discount("teacher") would return 13.5 and burger.discount("public") would return 16.2

Write a function to return a review based on the index of the review in the array.

Use the getReviewByIndex function below to do the following:

  2. The function should return the following string: "{name} gave the restaurant a {rating} star review, and their feedback was: {feedback}"
